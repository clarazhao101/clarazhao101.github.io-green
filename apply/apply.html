      <h3>Application Components:</h3>

      <p>Students will apply by submitting the following documents through the
        online application by midnight by midnight on
        Tuesday, April 30, 2019:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A project proposal addressing the criteria in the section
          below. Proposals should include the following details:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Project summary and description</li>
            <li>Outcome(s) from the project</li>
            <li>Timeline and budget</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A letter of recommendation from an advisor who will mentor
          the student project. The advisor can be either a UCD
          faculty or staff with appropriate expertise to
          support the proposed project.</li>
        <li>One (or more) letters in support of the proposal from
          the SLLC community or communities that will be directly
          impacted by the project.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Project Criteria:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The project should benefit the SLLC and be in relationship to its
        physical or program resources. SLLC programs are the Student Farm,
        the Domes and Tri-Coops, Project Compost, Solar Decathlon, and the
        Design-Lab. Connection of the fellowship work to the programs and space of
        the SLLC allows for continuity and year after year learning.</li>
      <li>The project should be designed in a way to have positive impacts for
        both social justice and environmental sustainability.</li>
      <li>An interdisciplinary approach to the project is necessary to ensure that
        the above is adequately addressed. Examples would be a project that focuses
         on waste management through composting and manifests in a work of art; or
         a project that focuses on the history of labor in California and manifests
         in new training or internship programs for SLLC gardeners and farmers.</li>
      <li>A connection to the UCâ€™s Land Grant mission of serving the community.
        Projects must be documented with materials appropriate to support ongoing
        conversations about the important long-term impacts of UC Davis student-led
        efforts in the areas of social justice, appropriate technology and
        environmental sustainability.</li>
    </ol>
