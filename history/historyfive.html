                <p>"UC Davis adopted the "Principles of Community" on April 20, 1990, which served as a major reference for the development of the Cross Cultural Center. The CCC planning process began when a coalition of students and staff in support of a multicultural center submitted a proposal to the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs in the winter of 1990. The Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs appointed a planning committee on May 4, 1990, composed of students, staff, faculty, and administrators to refine the proposal. Mission: Born out of student activism and political struggle, the UC Davis Cross Cultural Center provides a culturally relevant community space where student voices can be expressed and respected. The CCC cultivates critical consciousness and cultural competency by providing learning opportunities at the crossroads of the many aspects of our identities and experiences. By embracing our cultural and intellectual heritage, the CCC supports student leadership in advancing our collective vision for community empowerment and social justice.""

                  <p>Project Compost was started from an internship with the campus-recycling program (R4 Recycling) in the Fall
                  of 1999. The internship was outlined by the intern (Max Cadji) and shaped by the R4 project director. The recycling program was able to divert newspaper, bottles, cans, scrap wood, and even scrap metal, but when it came to food waste and agricultural waste there was no available infrastructure for diversion.Winter 2001 brought about an opportunity to make this trial project a reality, money surfaced in student government, when Project Recycle (a student-run recycling program) was taken over by the university recycling program (R4). With some heavy lobbying to the student government and a subsequent bill, Project Compost became a reality. Fall 2001-2002 kicked off the Project Compost official drive to spread the glory of compost throughout the university! Project Compost merged with Campus Center for the Environment (CCE) in Fall of 2015. Now as a subunit of another unit of ASUCD, Project Compost still acts under its two part mission of Action and Education, but we now have more resources and opportunities for collaboration.

                <p>Upon the formation of the Coalition in 2003, Black students across the UC were facing low admissions and retention numbers as well as acts of ignorance and intolerance. Now, in the face of a 2012 Admissions Policy projected to cut underrepresented student numbers, fee increases, hate crimes, plans to reduce student services and lack of Black tenured faculty, we are still facing many of the same issues. Unifying Black students across campuses is more important than ever. As one of the only system-wide collectives for Black students, the Afrikan Black Coalition is a vital tool in promoting networking amongst peers, generating positive images of Black students and staff to their campus communities, inspiring innovation in a system that honors hard facts and calculation, and providing an environment where the Black cultural experience is valued.</p>

                    <p>After more than 30 years the school lost its accreditation in January 2005. The doors were chained and locked closed while also being directed to remove highway signs pointing visitors to D-Q by the California Department of Transportation. However, a small group of student refused to leave and conducted a sit in as they called upon the activist and founders for aid. The fall out of D-Q university was hard to bare and the rebirth of the university will be no easy challenge. To this day D-Q University remains active in standing up and fighting for the injustices continuously given to Indigenous Peoples.

About thirty students signed up. There were as many as ten, and less than twenty students playing a game of “Capture the Illegal Immigrant.” The event was organized by Ryan Clumpner, a UC Davis student who grew up in Davis. This game was interrupted by student prosters doing a rally, who came and surrounded the players 2-1, and stopping the game by being present.

                            <p>Police arrested 52 students protesting a tuition hike Thursday at the University of California-Davis and held them in jail overnight without food. One was reportedly beaten by police. The incident took place in the midst of widespread protests at several University of California campuses, in response to the Board of Regents’ decision this week to hike tuition fees by 32 percent starting next academic year. The protesters held a sit-in in Mrak Hall, an administration building on the UC-Davis campus near Sacramento that the authorities told protesters to vacate by 5 p.m. Thursday evening. Officers from the Yolo County sheriff’s office moved in and arrested those who didn’t comply with the order. One protester was roughed up and held in solitary confinement all night.

                                <p>A grassroots group of UC Davis undergraduate students held a ‘naked’ rally on UC Davis campus today, protesting the University of California’s plans for massive tuition hikes and budget cuts. A dozen scantily-clad protestors, wearing little more than protest signs (but dressed within legal limits), urged students to participate in a UC-system-wide student, faculty and staff walkout and one-day strike on Thursday, Sept. 24th. Meanwhile, other protestors handed out literature and talked to passers-by.</p>
