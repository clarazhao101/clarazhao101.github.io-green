                  <p>Student demonstrations at UC Davis, Chancellor Meyer presented with a list of student demands from a protest of ~1000 students.</p>
                  <p>"One of the reasons that during the late ’60s and early ’70s the Davis campus avoided the violence that faced many campuses during that time — a violence that reached its tragic height in the shooting deaths of four protesters at Kent State — was that the administration, led by Chancellor Meyer, declined to engage in strong-arm, repressive tactics in response to student protests. Instead, Chancellor Meyer met with protest leaders, engaging them in a serious exchange about their grievances and demands, and set a tone of moderation that avoided aggravating the campus situation. In a later interview, Chancellor Meyer referred to the tear gassing of protesters at UC Berkeley as “one of the dumbest things that anyone ever could think of.” (Don Hubin, Class of 1972)

The Women’s Liberation UCD student organization formed and, with support of faculty and staff, influenced the chancellor to appoint a task force on the status of women at UC Davis. Shortly after, in the Winter of 1971, The Women’s Center was born and staffed primarily by members of the Women’s Liberation student organization and volunteers. The center provided referral services, literature, peer counseling and support groups.</p>

The students used art to teach visitors about the realms of activism, wellness, and environmental sustainability in an interactive and creative way. Following the United Nations’ recognition of Earth Day in 1970, the event was renamed to the Whole Earth Festival, fondly nicknamed as “WEF,” and has since evolved into a free student-run event, attracting over 30,000 visitors annually on Mother’s Day weekend.</p>

                            <p>Few people are aware that there were two universities in and near Davis. The "other" one was D-Q University, a tribal community college that had a focus on indigenous peoples. It was the only tribal university in California and faced severe financial and accreditation issues. Founded in 1971, it was the only indigenous-controlled institution of higher learning located outside a reservation.</p>
                            <p>According to the DQU website, The "D" stands for the name of The Great Peacemaker who inspired the founding of the Iroquois Confederacy; the full name symbolized by the "D" is used only in a religious context. The "Q" represents Quetzalcoatl, an Aztec prophet, who symbolizes the principles of wisdom and self-discipline. One goal of the school was to unite people of Native American and Chicano ancestries, and so the usage of these two names together was reflective of a desire to blend traditions.</p>

                              <p>The term Third World was created during the mid 50s at the Non-Aligned Conference in Bandung, Indonesia . Countries that had recently celebrated independence from Colonial powers chose a third path different and separate from that of the Capitalist First World and the Pro-Soviet Second World. Many liberation movements in the US during the 60s chose this term to be a common front to fight imperialism and racism. From Saigon to Oakland , from Johannesburg to Jerusalem , from Vieques to Davis We need Third World Unity. As people of the Third World Forum, then, we stand against all forms of oppression and their manifestations such as imperialism, colonialism, racism, zionism, sexism, and heterosexism. We demand that the University of California uphold its own mission statement of providing "service to the region, state, nation, and the world" through the following actions:"</p>

Their intent was to celebrate themselves and to take a stand against the hxstorically and culturally exclusionary ideologies on campus. Every year marks a monumental step towards black empowerment and strengthening of our families. The family reflects the resilience, diversity and openness of black culture.

                <p>In June 1972, the Report of the Task Force on the Status of Women at UC Davis was published and stated that women at the university were still marginalized due to a lack of continuing education program, scholarships, fellowships and inadequate childcare. The report highlighted the need for a Women’s Center on the UC Davis campus. In October that year, the Women’s Center moved to Temporary Building (TB) 124. In 1974, the Women’s Center was restructured and renamed the Women’s Resources and Research Center (WRRC).</p>

                    <p>This farm was the first student farm to be created on a land grant university in the United States. Educational opportunities take place through student internships, volunteer positions, farm tours, workshops, elementary school field trips, and tens of formal classes in Colleges of Agriculture and Environmental Science, Engineering, and Letters and Sciences. The Market Garden currently has over 100 members in its community supported agriculture program (CSA) receiving seasonal, certified organic produce weekly. The Student Farm is a program of the Agricultural Sustainability Institute (ASI), promoting social, economic, and environmental sustainability in agriculture.</p>
