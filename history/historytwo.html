                  <p>The station now known as KDVS was formed by the students of the now-defunct Beckett-Hughes dormitories in late 1963. KCD began operations on February 1, 1964, broadcasting from the laundry room of all-male Beckett Hall. Although this situation could have resulted in the exclusion of women, arrangements were made to accommodate female staff. Initially, the KCD signal was carried by “carrier current” on the AC phone lines and could be received on 880 AM by residents of certain dormitories. The first words ever broadcasted on KCD were, “Watson! Come here! I need a quarter!”</p>

                                <p>Powwow, as practiced today, is a social gathering intended to provide the campus and local community a space to learn about, engage with, and celebrate the traditions and cultures of Indigenous peoples, and bring visibility to the vibrancy of Native American music, dance, and arts.
                                <p>Held in 1969, the first UC Davis Powwow was hosted in conjunction with the creation of the Native American Studies Department and has since been the culminating event for the Native American Culture Days events and programs. The UC Davis Powwow is student-run and student-planned, standing as one of the longest running student powwows in California.
                                <p>Those who serve on the UC Davis Powwow Committee are able to maintain their roots and build a stronger connection to their Indigenous identities, while navigating a Western educational institution. The annual event has gained national recognition for hosting vendors, dancers, judges, head staff, drum groups, and attendees from both California and all throughout Indian Country.<p>
                                <p>The UC Davis Powwow also benefits the campus community by promoting cross-cultural communication and alliances and supporting both the recruitment and retention of Native American students at UC Davis. Altogether, everything put into preparing and holding the annual UC Davis Powwow affords the opportunity for the campus and local Native community to build connections to address the social, cultural, historical and political issues facing Indigenous people today.</p>

                                      <p>"Ag Effort was founded in 1969 when UCD offered the 4 houses which are now the On Campus Co-ops and The House to student clubs. These craftsman style houses were originally located on A street and inhabited by professors, but were moved to make room for new construction on the east side of campus.The student club Agrarian Action was given Temporary Building 15 and over an acre of land to use. The Student Housing office was built on a significant portion of the club's land in the early 1990's, but nearly 2/3 of an acre are still used as organic gardens by the Tri Co-op community.</p>

                                      <p>Agrarian Effort, Agressive Effort or Ag for short, is one of three On Campus Co-ops. It features a porch, a collection of dvds, vinyl, vcr, and books and zines. Behind the house is a large organic garden where Tri Co-opers grow produce, native plants, and flowers. The Co-op is managed by Solar Community Housing Association (SCHA), but run by students. The rent is fairly stable and will increase only with the consent of the residents. While affordability is subjective, its legal status as affordable housing makes it one of the cheapest options in Davis, especially so for being on campus. Living in a co-op also offers a lot of food security, because part of the months board is paid into a house account that is then used to buy collective groceries. Housemates are all responsible for household chores (of varying levels of physical and mental ability) and cooking/cleaning shifts."</p>

                                        <p>In 1969 Chicanx students from UC Davis, and throughout the country attended a conference at UC Santa Barbara organized by the Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education (CCCHE) in hopes of creating a network of students who could work together to create change and fight oppression on campus and in their communities.</p>
                                        <p>The outcome was the creation of El Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (M.E.Ch.A.) which means "Chicanx Student Movement", and the creation of several documents that would hold the test of time. M.E.Ch.A. de UC Davis is a grassroots, non-profit student organization that strives for political, social, and educational consciousness and equality. This Year MEChA has voted start the process of undergoing a name change that has the potential to restructure the Chicanx Studies curriculum it is noted for getting into the university's.</p>
