            <h3>Gabriela Fontanesi</h3>
            <p>Gabriela Fontanesi is a fourth year student from Los Angeles majoring in Viticulture and Enology. Gabriela has worked at the UC Davis Student Farm for 2 years so it’s only natural she created a project associated with the Student Farm Vineyard. Over the 2019-20 academic year, Gabriela plans to advance social justice and sustainability on the Student Farm by making the vineyard, and training in sustainable viticultural practices accessible to a broader community of students, including food insecure students, students from underserved/underrepresented communities, other Student Farm interns, and to the families/children of the workers in the Viticulture industry. To accomplish this goal she will create a new paid internship on the student farm vineyard for students who cannot afford to participate in unpaid internships. This will also help to advance the sustainability of the vineyard by bringing in experienced vineyard workers who understand the ins and out of viticultural techniques.
            </p>

            <p>Gabriela will be supported in her work by her mentor James R Muck, Field Operations CoordinatorUC Davis Student Farm who has guided her these past two years internship on her vineyard internship.</p>

              <h3>Destiny Padilla</h3>
              <p>Destiny Padilla is a fourth year student from San Diego, CA majoring in Sustainable Agriculture & Chicanx Studies. Destiny has served as the former External Vice President within ASUCD’s Office of Advocacy & Student Representation, created workshops for the Chicanx/Latinx community on health, wellness, gender & sexuality and is a labor organizer with United Students Against Sweatshops. For her Green Fellowship project she will create the Student Autonomous Collective supported by her mentor Natalia Deeb Sossa, an Associate Professor in the Chicanx Studies Department.</p>

              <p>At a 2019 Sustainable Living and Learning Communities meeting, students from various organizations and communities within the SLLC recognized the need for a Student Autonomous Collective within the master plan for the SLLC. With the support of her peers, Destiny is taking on the challenge to create an outline for the Student Autonomous Space that’s reflective of the needs from community members. She will conduct research, focus groups, and outreach specifically with marginalized students to develop a prototype, budget, and vision plan of what the physical space will look like when built in the near future.</p>

              <p>Working together with community members Destiny is hoping that this space will center around the most oppressed people, not a surface level space of inclusion but for voices to be heard and highlighted. This space will be used as a place to create lasting impactful change where members can develop radical work, coalition build, and knowledge share while being grounded in the values of collective liberation.</p>

          <h3>Aina Smart Truco</h3>
          <p>A 5th year Sustainable Environmental Design major from Davis, California, Aina is focusing her remaining quarters at UC Davis on her Green Fellowship project with the support of her mentor, Assistant Professor David de la Pena. Aina will use her creative skills to turn interviews with activists from the past and present into a “documentary film, an artistic installation, and a storybook research paper to visually animate these leaders experiences.” She imagines her project “can be used as the beginning of a new movement of activism on campus, where a better understanding of where we’ve come from can inform how we pursue a more progressive and idealistic future by getting more students involved and pushing for change.”</p>

          <p>Aina brings significant experience to the Green Fellowship. Already at UC Davis she has taken on large projects with the D-Lab where she helped design a insulation testing chamber, the experimental course “Bending the Curve” where she helped re-imagine a renewable fueling parking area, and for a study abroad course in Barcelona, Spain she helped create a short documentary video based on interviews about urban planning initiatives with local stakeholders.</p>

            <h3>Christopher Almaraz</h3>
            <p>He is new to UC Davis but Christopher Almaraz is already jumping into opportunities on campus. A junior transfer student and Communications major from Salinas, California, Christopher enrolled at UC Davis in Fall 2018 and immediately connected with the community at the Student Farm as he explored his interests on campus including his passion for food justice.</p>

            <p>For his Fellowship project, Christopher will interview past activists and student leaders and will create multi-media art and information installation of photos, handouts, art work and virtually any artifacts that can be used to understand something about the people, institutions or cultures of the past.</p>

            <p>His interest in this type of project was sparked at Hartnell Community College where he learned about what sociologist to refer to as a “Sociological Imagination” and began to recognize the disconnect the majority of society has with food and the importance of sustainable agriculture and technologies. Christopher’s background also includes work on an organic farm alongside coursework in communications, sociology and psychology. He will be supported by his mentor, Kait Murray, a current Ph.D. student in the Education Graduate Group and Director of First Year experience at UC Davis.</p>
